export const WEB_FETCH_TOOL_NAME = 'WebFetch'

export const DESCRIPTION = `Fetches a URL, converts the page to markdown, and answers \`prompt\` against it using a small fast model.

- Fails on authenticated/private URLs (Google Docs, Confluence, Jira, GitHub) — use an authenticated MCP tool, or \`gh\` via Bash for GitHub, instead.
- Fails on localhost and other hostnames without a dot; for a local server, use curl via Bash.
- HTTP is upgraded to HTTPS. Cross-host redirects are returned to you rather than followed; call again with the redirect URL.
- Responses are cached for 15 minutes per URL.
